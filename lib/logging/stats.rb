# Simple statistics collection and logging module.

module Logging::Stats

  # A very simple little class for doing some basic fast statistics
  # sampling. You feed it either samples of numeric data you want measured
  # or you call Sampler#tick to get it to add a time delta between the last
  # time you called it. When you're done either call sum, sumsq, num, min,
  # max, mean or sd to get the information. The other option is to just
  # call to_s and see everything.
  #
  # It does all of this very fast and doesn't take up any memory since the
  # samples are not stored but instead all the values are calculated on the
  # fly.
