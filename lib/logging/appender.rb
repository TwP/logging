# The +Appender+ class is provides methods for appending log events to a
# logging destination. The log events are formatted into strings using a
# Layout.
#
# All other Appenders inherit from this class which provides stub methods.
# Each subclass should provide a +write+ method that will write log
# messages to the logging destination.
#
# A private +sync+ method is provided for use by subclasses. It is used to
# synchronize writes to the logging destination, and can be used by
# subclasses to synchronize the closing or flushing of the logging
# destination.
